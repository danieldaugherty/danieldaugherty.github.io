52: The Mystery of the Loneliest Whale is a documentary Alldayeveryday co-produced. It follows the 52 Hz blue whale, relegated to solitude by his unusually-high-pitched song; inaudible to any other whale. Style points: Adrian Grenier is the spokesman for this documentary.

I changed the <a href="//52thesearch.com">52 tumblr</a> banner background to a video with BigVideo.js, built a small api to service the live follow/like counts, and added a pop-up with social icons and counts. Optimized for cross-browser compatibility.

Techs used:
- BigVideo.js
- jQuery
- HTML/CSS
- API
- Node.js, ExpressJS
- MongoDB
- CORS
