Trade-Away</a> is a sandboxed securities trading platform. Built in 2 days, this was a project I did for an interview process. It does not trade actual securities, but rather mimics the architecture of real securities trading platforms.

This app was built with the following techs:
- Meteor.js
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB
- HTML5/CSS3
